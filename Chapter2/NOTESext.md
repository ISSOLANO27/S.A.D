## Critical Success Factors (video)

`Critical Success Factors (CSFs)` are the few objectives that **must** be achieved or the initiative fails. They are **critical to organizational viability**, **benefit the entire organization**, and **align with organizational goals**. Typical decision metrics: `cost of investment`, `payback period`, `return on investment (ROI)`, `market penetration`.

**Mini-Check — Interview Ready**

* **What’s a CSF?** A must-achieve objective without which the mission fails.
* **Two common CSF financial metrics?** `ROI` and `payback period`.

## Chapter Introduction

You’ll be able to: connect `strategic planning` to IT projects; use `SWOT`; build a `business case`; list six reasons for `system requests`; separate internal vs external factors; describe intake and committee processing; assess `feasibility` (`operational`, `economic`, `technical`, `schedule`); set priorities (including `discretionary` vs `nondiscretionary`); and run a complete `preliminary investigation` that ends with a management report.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.1 Strategic Planning

`Strategic planning` identifies long-term `goals`, `strategies`, and `resources` (3–10+ year horizon). While teams fix today’s defects, leadership plans for major capabilities (e.g., a new `data warehouse`) and vets proposals against a `business case`.

**Mini-Check**

* **Strategic vs daily ops?** Multi-year direction and resource alignment vs routine tasks.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.1.1 Strategic Planning Overview

Begins with a `mission statement` (the firm’s `vision`, `purpose`, `values`). From the mission come short-term `goals` and measurable `objectives` with `milestones`. High-priority objectives are `CSFs`. Example mission (Google): *“to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”*

**Mini-Check**

* **Mission vs CSF?** Mission = why we exist; CSF = specific must-win objective to achieve it.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.1.2 SWOT Analysis

`SWOT` = `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `opportunities`, `threats`. A `SWOT analysis` can focus on a product, project, division, enterprise, or even a `mission statement`. It helps avoid unrealistic or unprofitable goals.

**MD diagram (Fig 2-1 style):**

```
Strengths                  Weaknesses
- Excellent web team       - Legacy systems
- Low analyst turnover     - Budget increases denied
- Upgraded network         - Docs outdated

Opportunities              Threats
- First w/ new software    - Aggressive competition
- B2B growth potential     - New FCC rules impact
                            - Competitors offer better benefits
```

**MD diagram (Fig 2-2 style — SWOT of a Patent):**

```
Patent (asset)
  Strengths: Valuable tech used in popular products
  Weaknesses: Limited life; expires → no protection
  Opportunities: License/use in more products; seek more patents
  Threats: Competing non-infringing similar tech
```

**Mini-Check**

* **Why do SWOT before setting goals?** To fit ambitions to reality (capability + environment).

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.1.3 The Role of the IT Department

`Systems analysts` connect technical work to strategy. Early planning ensures `business alignment`, clear `scope`, and realistic `goals`. Modern development is **team-oriented** (e.g., `agile methods`) with `users`, `managers`, and `IT` collaborating from the start. Some orgs still use IT as a `gatekeeper`; larger firms often use a `systems review committee`.

**Mini-Check**

* **Gatekeeper vs collaborative IT?** IT screens alone vs cross-functional evaluation and delivery.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.2 Strategic Planning Tools

Analysts may use `Word` or `Excel` for structured planning. `CASE tools` integrate statements, entities, data, and diagrams into a consistent model. Cloud roadmapping tools (Fig 2-3) align strategy, vision, development, and communication. Other techniques: `mind maps`, `balanced scorecards`, `gap analysis`.

**Mini-Check**

* **Is Microsoft Project a CASE tool?** No—`project management` (scheduling), not system design.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.3 The Business Case

A `business case` justifies an initiative: purpose, alternatives, costs, benefits, risks, and metrics.

**It must answer:**

* Why this project? What is it? Which issues does it address?
* How much, how long, who’s involved?
* Will there be a productivity dip?
* What’s the `ROI` and `payback period`?
* Risks of doing vs not doing?
* Which `metrics/KPIs` measure success?
* What alternatives exist?

**Mini-Check**

* **What distinguishes a strong business case?** Clear link to goals, quantified costs/benefits, risks/alternatives, and defined success metrics.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.4 System Requests

A `system request` formally asks for IT support: enhancements, fixes, replacements, or new systems (Fig 2-4).

### Stronger Controls

Security and accuracy via `passwords`, role-based access, `encryption`, and `biometrics` (Fig 2-5). Balance control with usability.

### Reduced Costs

Legacy operations may be expensive due to faults, design limits, or new demands. Use `cost-benefit analysis` to compare upgrade vs replace.

### More Information

Existing reporting may not answer new decisions (e.g., trend analysis).

### Better Performance

Issues like slow response, poor scalability, or hardware obsolescence.

### Improved Service

Customer/user self-service, preference storage, online registration.

### More Support for New Products and Services

New offerings require new IT capabilities; vendor `end-of-support` can force upgrades.

**Mini-Check**

* **Two common reasons for requests?** `Improved service` and `reduced costs` (others: controls, information, performance, new offerings).

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.5 Factors Affecting System Projects

### 2.5.1 Internal Factors

`Strategic plan`, `top managers` (sponsorship), `user requests`, `IT department` capacity/skills, `existing systems & data` (technical debt, integration), `company finances`.

**Mini-Check**

* **Why strategic alignment matters?** It unlocks sponsorship and budget and ensures impact.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.5.2 External Factors

Scan with `PESTEL`: `Political`, `Economic`, `Social`, `Technological`, `Environmental`, `Legal`.

* **Technology:** `barcodes`, `QR codes` (Fig 2-7), `RFID` & `EPC`, `IoT` → opportunities and new `security/privacy` risks.
* **Suppliers:** `EDI` + `JIT` for inventory timing; `blockchain` for tamper-evident traceability.
* **Customers:** `CRM` (often linked to `SCM`); `EPOD` for automated delivery reconciliation.
* **Competitors:** Parity vs differentiation drives roadmaps.
* **Economy:** Payback thresholds and scaling expectations vary with cycles.
* **Government:** Regulations (IRS, HIPAA, PCI, GDPR/CCPA) shape requirements and audits.

**PESTEL → Requirement (examples)**

* `Legal` → consent, audit logs, retention; meet deadline.
* `Technological` → support `RFID/QR/IoT`; add auth/encryption/patching.
* `Economic` → prioritize <12–18-month payback.

**Mini-Check**

* **Give one PESTEL factor with a likely requirement.** `Legal` → audit logging & retention.

## 2.6 Processing System Requests

Intake often exceeds capacity; use standardized forms, tooling, and a `Systems Review Committee`. Flow: intake → triage → `preliminary investigation` → stage-gate decision → prioritization → charter.

### 2.6.1 System Request Forms

Good forms standardize: requester, problem/opportunity, impact, desired outcome, scope hints, urgency, constraints, `KPIs`, alternatives, attachments. Mission-critical incidents are stabilized immediately, then documented.

### 2.6.2 System Request Tools

`ITSM`-style tools capture, route (via `business rules`), track `SLAs`, and analyze throughput/bottlenecks.

### 2.6.3 Systems Review Committee

Cross-functional group (with `IT Director`) scores requests using published criteria to reduce bias and set portfolio priorities. Drawbacks (cadence/politics) are mitigated by transparent criteria and minutes.

**Mini-Check**

* **Committee’s main value?** Diverse expertise + transparent, defensible prioritization.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

## 2.7 Assessing Request Feasibility

### 2.7.1 Feasibility Studies

Quick evaluation across `operational`, `economic`, `technical`, `schedule`.

**Mini-Check**

* **Why early feasibility?** Avoid committing to unworkable/low-value projects.

### 2.7.2 Operational Feasibility

Will users adopt it and does it truly solve the issue? Consider workflow fit, policy, training, and change management.

**Interview-Ready** — Evidence: pilot results, usability scores, error/time reductions.

### 2.7.3 Economic Feasibility

Do benefits outweigh costs?

* **Costs:** dev/licensing, operations, training/downtime.
* **Benefits:** labor saved, revenue gained, risk/penalty avoided.
* **Formulas:**

  * `ROI = (Annual Benefit – Annual Cost) / Total Investment`
  * `Payback = Total Investment / Annual Net Benefit`

### 2.7.4 Technical Feasibility

Do we have the stack, integrations, data quality, and skills? Consider architecture fit, security, performance, and vendor support windows.

### 2.7.5 Schedule Feasibility

Can we deliver by the required date? Tune by scoping, adding capacity, parallelization, or phasing.

**Mini-Check**

* **Four feasibility dimensions?** `Operational`, `Economic`, `Technical`, `Schedule` (O/E/T/S).

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

## 2.8 Setting Priorities

### 2.8.1 Dynamic Priorities

Priorities change with strategy shifts, incidents, deadlines, budgets, and market moves. Use rolling cadences and explicit re-ranking rules.

### 2.8.2 Factors That Affect Priority

Weighted criteria (example): `strategic alignment`, `value/ROI`, `compliance risk`, `user impact`, `technical feasibility`, `cost/capacity`, `time criticality`, `security/privacy`.

### 2.8.3 Discretionary and Nondiscretionary Projects

`Discretionary` = management **chooses** (e.g., analytics dashboard).
`Nondiscretionary` = **must do** (compliance, safety, vendor EOL). Many are predictable (payroll/tax updates); calendar them to protect strategic capacity.

**Mini-Check**

* **Quick test for nondiscretionary?** If delay breaks a law/contract/safety or blocks revenue collection.

## 2.9 The Preliminary Investigation

**Model (Fig 2-12):**

```
[Fact-Finding at the center]
  ↖ Problem/Opportunity      ↗ Benefits
  ↙ Scope & Constraints      ↘ Costs
→ Output: Report to Management
```

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.9.1 Planning the Preliminary Investigation

Inform stakeholders about purpose and approach; explain the analyst’s role (neutral fact-finder and translator between business and IT). Expect resistance; avoid accusatory words like “problem.” Ask about desired `capabilities`, run “show me” walk-throughs, quantify pain (minutes/errors/\$), and confirm understanding (“playback” summary).

**Mini-Check**

* **Why avoid “what’s your problem?”** It biases conversations; focusing on capabilities generates better requirements.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.9.2 Performing the Preliminary Investigation

**Five Steps (Fig 2-13):**

1. **Understand the Problem/Opportunity**
2. **Define Project Scope & Constraints**
3. **Perform Fact-Finding**
4. **Study Usability, Cost, Benefit, Schedule Data**
5. **Evaluate Feasibility (O/E/T/S)**

---

**Step 1 — Understand the Problem or Opportunity (root-cause view)**
Use a `fishbone (Ishikawa)` diagram (Fig 2-14): head = effect; big slanted bones = categories; small bones = causes; mini-bones = sub-causes. Keep asking **“why?”** until you hit roots that explain multiple symptoms.

**MD fishbone sketch:**

```
Head: "Low Morale"
Backbone →--------------------------------------→

  / Management: poor comms; no 1:1s; unclear goals
 /  Work Env: too hot/cold; noisy; crowded
/   Tools/Tech: outdated SW; slow PCs
\   Policies: opaque reviews; no career path
 \  People: training gaps; overtime; turnover
  \ ...
```

---

**Step 2 — Define Project Scope & Constraints**
`Scope` = what’s in/out (avoid `project creep`).
`Constraints` = required conditions (hardware, software, time, policy/law, cost).

**Constraint characteristics (Fig 2-15):**

* `Present` vs `Future`
* `Internal` vs `External`
* `Mandatory` vs `Desirable`

**Examples:**

* “Order system must accept input from 15 remote sites” (present/external/mandatory).
* “New website operational by March 1” (present/internal/mandatory).

---

**Step 3 — Perform Fact-Finding**
Primary methods and tips:

**A) Conduct Interviews (7 steps)**

1. Identify interviewees
2. Set objectives
3. Develop questions (include open-ended)
4. Prepare logistics
5. Conduct interview (listen; don’t sell)
6. Document responses
7. Evaluate the interview

**B) Review Documentation** — Validate accuracy with users.

**C) Observe Operations** — Shadow actual work; trace inputs/outputs.

**D) User Survey** — Broader reach; less depth but faster.

**E) Analyze the Data**

* `Pareto` chart (Fig 2-17) ranks causes by frequency/impact (80/20 focus).
* `XY/Scatter` (Fig 2-18) shows relationships (e.g., users vs response time).

**MD Pareto sketch:**

```
|■■■■■■■■■■             | Improper part number
|■■■                    | Invalid codes
|■■                     | Out-of-date part number
|■                      | Address correction needed
...
```

**MD Scatter sketch:**

```
Users →   .     . . .  .     .
Time  ↑ .   .  .   .  .  . .
```

---

**Step 4 — Study Usability, Cost, Benefit, Schedule Data**
Tabulate findings: usability risks, projected costs (one-time/recurring), benefits (tangible/intangible), and schedule constraints. Prepare inputs for feasibility.

---

**Step 5 — Evaluate Feasibility**
Summarize `operational`, `economic`, `technical`, `schedule` feasibility using the facts gathered. Identify major risks and mitigations, and whether to proceed to the next SDLC phase.

**Mini-Check**

* **Five steps (short list)?** Understand → Scope/Constraints → Fact-Finding → Analyze Data → Evaluate Feasibility.

[🏠 Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### 2.9.3 Summarizing the Preliminary Investigation

Deliver a **management report** (the **case for action**) that compiles everything succinctly.

**Recommended structure:**

1. **Introduction** — why the investigation was done (trigger/context).
2. **System Request** — the request that initiated work.
3. **Summary of Findings** — problem/opportunity, scope, constraints, key data.
4. **Recommendations** — chosen alternative and rationale.
5. **Project Roles** — sponsor, manager, users, IT involvement.
6. **Timing** — rough schedule/milestones or deadlines.
7. **Costs** — ballpark estimates (start-up & recurring).
8. **Expected Benefits** — tangible & intangible; `ROI`/`payback` when possible.
9. **Appendix** — supporting charts (SWOT, fishbone, Pareto, survey results, etc.).

**Mini-Check**

* **What’s the final output of the prelim investigation?** A management report recommending action, supported by O/E/T/S feasibility and facts.

## Review Questions — Answers

> Each answer links back to the section where it’s developed in the notes.

1. **Why should a systems analyst be interested in strategic planning?**
   Because analysts translate business strategy into systems that deliver value. Understanding `strategic planning` ensures projects align with mission/CSFs, have clear scope, and realistic goals, rather than isolated technical tasks. See [2.1](#21-strategic-planning) & [2.1.3](#213-the-role-of-the-it-department).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

2. **List the four factors involved in a SWOT analysis.**
   `Strengths`, `Weaknesses`, `Opportunities`, `Threats`. See [2.1.2](#212-swot-analysis).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

3. **Describe how CASE tools can support strategic planning.**
   `CASE tools` integrate statements, entities, data elements, and diagrams into a consistent model; they raise quality, reduce effort, and keep documentation in sync. Roadmapping tools align vision to delivery. See [2.2](#22-strategic-planning-tools).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

4. **List five questions the business case should answer.**
   Why the project; what it does; how it addresses key issues; how much/how long/who; `ROI` & `payback`; risks of doing/not doing; metrics for success; alternatives. See [2.3](#23-the-business-case).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

5. **What are the six main reasons for systems requests?**
   `Stronger controls`, `reduced costs`, `more information`, `better performance`, `improved service`, and `more support for new products/services`. See [2.4](#24-system-requests).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

6. **Explain the two main factors affecting systems requests.**
   `Internal factors` (strategy, managers, user requests, IT capacity, existing systems/data, finances) and `external factors` (technology, suppliers, customers, competitors, economy, government). See [2.5](#25-factors-affecting-system-projects).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

7. **Describe the role of the systems review committee in processing systems requests.**
   The `Systems Review Committee` evaluates requests with diverse expertise, reduces bias, sets priorities transparently, and governs stage-gates; tooling and forms support intake/triage. See [2.6](#26-processing-system-requests).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

8. **Define operational, economic, technical, and schedule feasibility.**
   `Operational`: users will adopt & it solves the need.
   `Economic`: benefits outweigh costs (ROI/payback).
   `Technical`: tech/skills/integrations exist at acceptable risk.
   `Schedule`: can deliver in the required window. See [2.7](#27-assessing-request-feasibility) and [2.9.2 Step 5](#292-performing-the-preliminary-investigation).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

9. **List seven questions the systems analyst should consider when assessing project priorities.**
   Which requests align with strategy; value/ROI/payback; compliance risk/deadlines; user impact; technical feasibility/architecture fit; cost/capacity; time criticality; security/privacy. (A weighted scheme is typical.) See [2.6.3](#263-systems-review-committee) & [2.8.2](#282-factors-that-affect-priority).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

10. **What are the five steps of a preliminary investigation?**

11. Understand problem/opportunity; 2) Define scope & constraints; 3) Perform fact-finding; 4) Study usability, cost, benefit, schedule; 5) Evaluate feasibility. See [2.9.2](#292-performing-the-preliminary-investigation).

## Discussion Topics — Responses

1. **“Mission statements are nice, but they don’t change things where the work gets done.” How do you reply?**
   A mission is the **north star** that cascades into goals, `objectives`, and `CSFs` that *do* change daily work—by shaping what gets funded, prioritized, and measured. Without it, projects drift or conflict. Example: a mission prioritizing accessibility leads to concrete objectives (e.g., mobile self-service), clear milestones, and resource allocation. See [2.1.1](#211-strategic-planning-overview).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

2. **How can a company’s financial status affect systems projects?**
   Finances drive **capacity and thresholds**: availability of capital/operating budget, required `payback` windows, hiring vs automation choices, and tolerance for long-horizon bets. In lean times, nondiscretionary/compliance work and cost-reduction automation rise; in expansions, scalable platforms and growth features win. See `Internal factors` in [2.5.1](#251-internal-factors) and `Economic` in [2.5.2](#252-external-factors).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

3. **VP of Accounting says the request procedure takes too long; suggests bypassing intake and starting immediately. Your response?**
   Intake and `preliminary investigation` protect the portfolio from bias and rework. Standardized forms/tools plus a `Systems Review Committee` ensure urgent `nondiscretionary` work is fast-tracked **with traceability**, while avoiding whiplash priorities. Propose a **minimal viable compliance** path (if applicable) with a time-boxed stage-gate, preserving rigor without delay. See [2.6](#26-processing-system-requests) and [2.8.3](#283-discretionary-and-nondiscretionary-projects).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

4. **Reconciling short-term wins vs long-term excellence when prioritizing projects.**
   Use a weighted model: guarantee capacity for **must-do** compliance/safety; reserve a slice for **short-term high-ROI** improvements; invest in **long-term platforms** with staged value (MVP → phases) and explicit stage-gates to reduce risk. Publish criteria/weights and revisit on a cadence to keep politics at bay. See [2.8.1](#281-dynamic-priorities) & [2.8.2](#282-factors-that-affect-priority).
   **\[Back to TOC]**

5. **Report vs presentation — which is most effective for conveying preliminary investigation results?**
   Use **both**: a concise written report is the authoritative record (details, assumptions, feasibility, appendices), and a brief presentation highlights recommendations, risks, and next steps for decision-makers. The presentation links to the report for depth. See [2.9.3](#293-summarizing-the-preliminary-investigation).
