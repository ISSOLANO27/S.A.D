# Notes: Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)

### Overview

* **Structured Analysis** treats **processes** and **data** as separate.
* **Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)** combines **data + processes** into a single unit called an **object**.
* Objects are used to model **real-world people, things, transactions, and events**.
* Result: **software objects** that mirror **business processes and operations**.

---

### Objects and Classes

* An **object** = a member of a **class** (collection of similar objects).
* Objects have **characteristics** called **properties** (attributes).
* Properties can be:

  * **Inherited** from the class.
  * **Unique** to the object itself.

**Example:**

* **Class:** `Person`

  * Subclasses: `Instructor`, `Student`.
  * Shared property: `Address` (all persons).
  * Unique property: `GPA` (only students).

---

### Methods and Messages

* **Methods** = built-in processes that change an object’s properties.

  * Example: `Order.Status` may change when a **Customer** places, confirms, or cancels an order.
* **Messages** = communication between objects.

  * One object sends a **request** for behavior/info to another.
  * Example: `Order` object asks `Customer` object for `Shipping Address`.
  * `Customer` responds with required info.

This shows **encapsulation**: each object knows how to handle messages relevant to it.

### Object-Oriented Modeling

* **Object models** represent **data + behavior** and show how **objects interact**.
* Benefits:

  * Create **reusable components** (reduce costs, speed up implementation).
  * More **realistic depiction** of business processes.

---

### Methodology & Lifecycle

* OOA follows **phases similar to the SDLC**, but with more **interaction** between steps.
* Typical cycle includes:

  * **Planning → Analysis → Design → Prototyping → Implementation.**
* OOA encourages **iterative prototyping**, testing, and refinement.
* This leads to a more **interactive model** than rigid structured analysis.

---

### Popularity & Languages

* OOA is popular because it aligns with **object-oriented programming languages**:

  * **C++**, **Java**, **Swift**, **Python**, etc.
* Provides a **smooth transition** from analysis/design into coding.

---

### Key Takeaways

* **Object = Data + Behavior.**
* **Class = Blueprint** for creating objects.
* **Properties = Characteristics** of objects.
* **Methods = Actions** objects can perform.
* **Messages = Communication** between objects.
* OOA supports **reusability, modularity, and scalability** in systems development.
