# Notes: Transaction Processing (TP)

## What is Transaction Processing?

* **Transaction Processing (TP) systems** handle data generated by daily business operations.
* Examples:

  * Customer order processing
  * Accounts receivable
  * Warranty claim processing

---

## How TP Systems Work

* Perform a **series of tasks** whenever a transaction occurs.
* Example: A sales transaction may involve multiple steps such as checking customer data, credit status, inventory, and updating records.
* TP systems handle **large amounts of data** and are **mission-critical** → companies cannot function without them.

## Example: Sales Transaction (Figure 1-11)

A single sales transaction consists of **six tasks**, processed as a group:

1. Verify customer data
2. Check credit status
3. Check stock status
4. Post to accounts receivable
5. Adjust inventory levels
6. Update sales file

---

## Efficiency & Data Integrity

* TP systems process related commands **as a group**, not individually.
* If **any one task fails**, the **entire transaction is rolled back** (not processed).
* This ensures **data integrity** and prevents inconsistent records.

---

## Key Takeaways

* TP systems = the **operational backbone** of enterprises.
* They ensure that every business action (like a sale) is properly recorded across all relevant systems.
* Their group-processing method prevents partial or corrupted transactions.

This section is basically saying that **TP systems are like referees** — they make sure every transaction either happens completely and correctly, or not at all.
