## 1.1 Information Technology

**Information Technology (IT)** = hardware + software + services used to manage, communicate, and share information.

* Companies use IT to:

  * Increase productivity
  * Deliver high-quality products/services
  * Maintain customer loyalty
  * Support better decision-making

* IT is essential in today’s global economy. Firms use it in:

  * Growth cycles → to stay competitive and expand
  * Slowdowns → to cut costs and increase efficiency

IT also shapes daily life: privacy, surveillance, mobile devices, and social media show how technology impacts society.

> IT isn’t just business infrastructure; it’s woven into our personal and civic lives.

---

## 1.1.1 The Changing Nature of Information Technology

* **History** shows IT evolves continuously: from TV and space flights to computing and AI.
* IBM’s story shows adaptation:

  * Started with **punch cards** (Hollerith’s 1896 invention).
  * Transitioned from **hardware company** → software & services giant.
  * Known for patents and Nobel Prize winners.

> Every leap in IT stands on older steps. Today’s cloud and AI rest on yesterday’s punch cards and silicon chips.

---

## 1.1.2 Systems Analysis and Design

**Systems Analysis and Design** = step-by-step method to build **information systems** that support business functions like HR, inventory, or accounting.

* Built by teams: managers, users, programmers, network admins, designers, and **system analysts**.
* Demand is always high—even in recessions.

> This field mixes business knowledge with technology skills: understanding how to support processes through systems.

---

## 1.1.3 What Does a Systems Analyst Do?

**Systems Analyst** = IT professional who plans, develops, and maintains information systems.

**Skills needed:**

* Communication
* Analytical + critical thinking
* Business knowledge + technical know-how

**Tasks they do:**

* Document processes
* Test software/hardware packages
* Design input screens
* Train users
* Plan e-commerce systems
* Manage IT projects (tasks, schedules, costs)
* Lead meetings, presentations, reports, documentation

Analysts may work:

* In IT departments
* Embedded in user departments (e.g., marketing)
* As outside consultants (common in small firms)

> Analysts are translators between business needs and technical solutions.

**Q: Is this a good starting point?**
Yes. A recent computer programming graduate can step into analyst-related roles, especially entry-level business analyst or junior systems analyst. The path often involves:

1. Building technical skills (programming, SQL, cloud, systems integration).
2. Learning business processes.
3. Growing into roles that involve designing solutions and leading projects.

---

## Information Systems

**System** = set of related components producing results.

* Examples: internet routers, microchip manufacturing, NASA telescopes.

**Mission-critical system** = system a company *cannot operate without* (e.g., order processing).

**Inputs** → **Data** (raw facts)
**Outputs** → **Information** (data transformed into useful form)

**Q: Who decides what’s “valuable information”?**
Usually, the **end user** decides. A manager, employee, or consumer determines whether the system’s output is useful for decision-making or daily life.

---

## 1.2.1 Hardware

**Hardware** = physical tech: servers, cables, mobile devices, scanners, etc.

* **Data center** = large building filled with interconnected computers/servers. Yes, these are massive rooms of machines, and tours are sometimes offered by companies like [Google Data Centers](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/).

* **Moore’s Law**: transistor count doubles every \~24 months → computing power skyrockets, cost drops.

> Hardware is the skeleton of IT systems; data centers are their beating hearts.

---

## 1.2.2 Software

**Software** = programs that tell hardware what to do.

Two types:

1. **System Software** → runs the machine and network

   * OS (Windows, Linux, macOS)
   * Security software
   * Device drivers
   * Utilities (backup, disk mgmt.)

   **Q: Can programmers sell system software to manufacturers?**
   Yes. Hardware companies often buy OS or software solutions rather than build them from scratch. For example, Dell PCs come with Microsoft Windows, which Dell licenses from Microsoft. As a programmer, you could design system-level tools/utilities and sell them to hardware vendors.

2. **Application Software** → helps with daily tasks

   * **Enterprise Applications** = large-scale, company-wide (e.g., payroll, order processing, ERP).
   * **Individual/Small Scale** = productivity apps. Examples:

     * Microsoft Excel (spreadsheets)
     * Microsoft Access (database management)

   **Q: Would PARS system be application software?**
   Yes—it supports business functions (patient scheduling), so it’s an application-level system.

   * **Horizontal systems** → reusable across industries (e.g., QuickBooks for accounting → [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/)).
   * **Vertical systems** → industry-specific (e.g., Electronic Health Record system like [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com/)).

---

## Data

**Data** = raw facts.
**Information** = processed, meaningful data.

* Stored in **relational databases** (tables linked together).
* Example: Payroll system links employee, hours, and city tables to produce custom reports.

**Big Data** = massive sets of structured + unstructured info.
**NoSQL Databases** = alternative models better for unstructured, scalable storage (MongoDB, Cassandra).

**Q: Difference between NoSQL and SQL?**

* SQL = structured tables, strict schema (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* NoSQL = flexible, schema-less, handles messy, changing data better.

---

## Processes

**Processes** = tasks/operations carried out to achieve business results.

* Analysts must map/document them carefully.

---

## People

**Stakeholders** = anyone with interest in the system:

* Managers
* Users (end users)
* IT staff

Success depends mostly on **user satisfaction**.

---

### Case in Point 1.2: Data Breaches

* **Data breach** = illegal access to systems where personal data is stolen (e.g., credit card info).
* Prevention includes: strong encryption, access controls, employee training, and continuous monitoring.

---

## 1.3 Internet Business Strategies

Trends shaping IT today:

* Globalization
* Cross-device integration
* Cloud computing

**E-commerce** = internet-based commerce.

* Common model: webpages + DB + servers + mobile apps as front ends.

---

### 1.3.1 B2C (Business-to-Consumer)

* Online shopping: consumers research, compare, purchase in one session.
* Cheaper than traditional sales channels.
* Examples: Amazon, Delta Airlines booking site.

---

### 1.3.2 B2B (Business-to-Business)

* Larger volume than B2C.
* Originated with **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**, now migrated to the web.
* **Supply Chain Management (SCM)** software manages complex supplier → customer chains.
* Example: SAP SCM solutions.

---

### 1.3.3 C2C (Consumer-to-Consumer)

* Consumers selling directly to other consumers online.
* Popular in secondhand fashion.
* Examples: [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/), [Mercari](https://www.mercari.com/).

Do you want me to expand the **“enterprise applications”** section into a mini deep-dive with modern real-world software (like SAP, Salesforce, Workday) and how they map to day-to-day business functions? That could strengthen your analyst prep.
