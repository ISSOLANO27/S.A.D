# Notes: Modeling Business Operations

## What is Modeling?

* **Modeling** = a graphical representation of a concept or process that systems developers can analyze, test, and modify.
* Purpose: Helps analysts simplify and describe information systems using **business, data, object, network, and process models**.

---

## Business Profile

* Overview of a company’s **mission, functions, organization, products, services, customers, suppliers, competitors, constraints, and future direction**.
* Acts as the **starting point** for modeling business processes.
* Systems analysts may need extra **research and fact-finding** to fill gaps.

---

## Business Model

* Describes the **information that a system must provide**.
* Analysts create models representing:

  * Data
  * Objects
  * Networks
  * Other system components
* These models overlap but work together to show the system from multiple perspectives.

---

## Business Process

* A **set of transactions, events, and results** that can be described and documented.
* **Business process model (BPM):** Graphically displays one or more processes.

  * Example: Airline reservation, filling a product order, updating a customer account.

---

## Business Process Modeling

* Involves:

  * A **business profile**
  * A **set of models** documenting operations
* Uses **Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** → method for developing information systems.

---

## Example: Sales Order Process

### Figure 1-8 (Basic Model)

* Event: Receive sales order
* Process 1: Check customer status
* Process 2: Verify customer credit
* Process 3: Enter customer order data
* Result: Completed sales order

---

### Figure 1-9 (Using BPMN)

* BPMN = **Business Process Modeling Notation**
* Standard shapes & symbols for events, processes, workflows.
* Same sales order example shown with BPMN symbols:

  * **Circle** = event (e.g., Receive sales order)
  * **Rounded rectangle** = process (e.g., Verify credit)
  * **Double circle** = result (e.g., Completed order)

---

### Figure 1-10 (Lucidchart Example)

* Tools like **Lucidchart** allow drag-and-drop of BPMN symbols.
* Can create:

  * Business process diagrams
  * Flowcharts
  * Organizational charts
  * Network diagrams
  * Workflow diagrams
* Used for **visualizing complex processes** interactively.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Modeling makes systems **understandable, testable, and improvable**.
* **Profiles** describe companies, **models** describe system info, and **process models** describe workflows.
* BPMN is a **standardized notation** that ensures clarity across teams.
* Tools like **Visio** and **Lucidchart** are widely used in practice.

Would you like me to also build a **mini glossary of BPMN symbols** (circle, diamond, rectangle, etc.) so you have a quick reference for when you start drawing your own diagrams?
