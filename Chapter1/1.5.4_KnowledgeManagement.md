# Notes: Knowledge Management

## What are Knowledge Management Systems?

* Systems that use a large database called a **knowledge base**.
* Allow users to find information by entering **keywords** or **questions in natural language**.
* Often include **inference rules** → logical rules that identify **data patterns and relationships**.

## Example: WolframAlpha

* Describes itself as a **computational knowledge engine**.
* Uses a sophisticated **natural language front end** to interpret user queries.
* Covers multiple domains:

  * Mathematics
  * Science & Technology
  * Society & Culture
  * Everyday Life
* Relies on:

  * Extensive **knowledge base** (aggregated from many sources)
  * Proprietary **algorithms** to process queries
* Outputs:

  * Detailed answers
  * Multimedia results (e.g., charts, text, math equations, etc.)

## Key Features of Knowledge Management

1. **Knowledge base** → stores information.
2. **Inference rules** → interpret data, reveal hidden patterns.
3. **User interface** → natural language queries for easy access.
4. **Multimedia output** → flexible presentation of knowledge.

## Key Takeaway

Knowledge management systems are **not just about storing data**; they **make knowledge actionable** by enabling reasoning, discovery, and decision support through rules and natural language interaction.
